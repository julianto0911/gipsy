# Clean Architecture

## Brief Introduction
Pardon for my bad english as i am not a native english speaker.
Here i would like to share my piece of code for clean architecture with golang.

My essential understanding about the concept of clean architecture, especially in the context of golang : 
1. Each parts should be independently able to be tested, replaceable, and maintainable.
2. Each layer should be indirectly access by other layer, in which we use interface to achieve it. 

I understand that clean code approach sometimes overwhelming for people that try to understand it.
Therefore here i will try to explain it as simple and easy as possible.

Here i will use my own terms, in accordance with the clean architecture. Some of you who may have experience on MVC, 
may find some of my terms are similar to MVC,or the way it works.
My structure may be different from the traditional clean architecture, but i believe it is more flexible and easier to understand for me, or hopefully for you too.



## Foundation 
Standard Layers :
1. Adaptor/Handler
    - This layer is responsible for handling the request and response.
    - It is the entry point of the application.
    - It is the only layer that can access the external world (http request, db, etc).

2. Use Case/Controller
    - This layer is responsible for processing the request and response.
    - It is the only layer that can access the internal world (business logic).
    - It is the only layer that can access the external world (http request, db, etc).

3. Data/Repository/Model
    - This layer is responsible for handling the data.
    - It is the only layer that can access the database.
    - It is the only layer that can access the external world (http request, db, etc).
    - This layer is responsible for handling the data.

## Folder Structure : 
```
project
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ cmd
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ server
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ internal
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ adaptor
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ repository
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ usecase
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ wire
â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ pkg
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ utils
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ middleware
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ ðŸ“‚ response
|-- .env
|-- go.mod
|-- go.sum
```

## First Form (Part 1):
_establish definition for data/table_

I would like to introduce terms "entity".
You can think of entity as a table structure/definition that will be used in the application.
It's similar to model in MVC.

For entity is stored in folder `internal/repository`.

```
type EProduct struct {
	ID   int64  `gorm:"column:id"`
	Name string `gorm:"column:name"`
}

```

E stands for entity, followed by name of entity.

You may also make definition of actual data using tagging, i used gorm tag for this.

You may also define foreign key, entity relationship, etc. 

JSON tag is not used here as it is not designed to be use for response directly.

I also create method named `TableName()` in the entity, it is used to define the table name in the database.
```
type EProduct struct {
	ID   int64  `gorm:"column:id"`
	Name string `gorm:"column:name"`
}

func (c *EProduct) TableName() string {
	return "products"
}

``` 


## First Form (Part 2):
_establish interface for entity_

After defining the entity, some source will interface it.
In our case, to maintain simplicity, we will skip it for the moment.

I will rather explain why we need interface, and how it works.

Interface enable us to replace the entity with other entity, without changing the code.
This is extremely useful especially when we do testing.

Example :
```
type productA struct{
    TableName() string
    Color string
}

type productB struct{
    TableName() string
    Size string
}

type IProduct interface{
    TableName() string
}

//we can return productA since productA implements IProduct interface
func returnA() IProduct{
    return &productA{}
}

//we can return productB since productB implements IProduct interface
func returnB() IProduct{
    return &productB{}
}

```

### First Form (Part 3):
_establish repository for entity_

In repository level, things get interesting.
```
type rProduct struct {
	db *gorm.DB
}
```

Here we have db property inside the repository. It is used to connect and access the database.
We can say that in repository, we do the actual database operation. 
Same like model in MVC, except in clean architecture, the operation and the object of the table are separated.
Smallcase r stands for repository, _i would like to make it private_.

Next, lets create method called `Create` inside the repository.

```
func (r *productRepo) Create(name string) (entity.EProduct, error) {
	product := EProduct{
        Name: name,
    }

	err := r.db.Create(&product).Error

	return &product, err
}
```
The Create method return an entity, and error.

You can add more method inside the repository, like `Get`, `Update`, `Delete`, etc, according to your need.

Ok, from here you already have a basic repository : 
1. a repository uses entity to get or push data into or from database, using database connection (db property).
2. a repository should contains only create,update,delete, get method, in the simplest way. It should not contain business logic.

## First Form (Part 4):
_establish interface for repository_

After defining the repository, we need to define the interface for it.

```
type RProduct interface {
	Create(name string) (*entity.EProduct, error)
}

```

Note that there is rProduct and RProduct. RProduct is the interface, and rProduct is the repository.

Then we create a function to return the repository, and inject the database connection into it.
```
// repository for product
func NewProductRepo(db *gorm.DB) RProduct {
	repo := &rProduct{
		db: db,
	}

	return repo
}
```

You will notice that we return an interface on the function.

Ok , before we continue, let's summarize what we got : 
1. entity : table definition
2. repository : actual operation of data, using database connection.
3. repository process and return entity.
4. repository's interface : to make the repository interchangeable on other level.
5. we create function that returns repository's interface, but what we return is the implementation of repository itself.


## Second Form (Part 1):
_establish usecase_

Simplified : Usecase is to Clean, as controller is to MVC.
